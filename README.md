### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- node-modules
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- auth/
|- UI/
|- main.dart

```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- auth - All the login functionality and navigation functionality to the required screens
2- ui‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains all the ui of your project, contains sub directory for each screen.
3- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the applications level of configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### auth

This directory all the login functionality and navigation functionality to the required screens. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
auth/
|- init.dart
```

### UI

This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `widgets` directory as shown in the example below:

```
ui/
|- .....

```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'auth/init.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: const FirebaseOptions(
        apiKey: "AIzaSyCeajJfDgq3znMdwEAvMB7wpYCRmTtOv2s",
        authDomain: "linkup-d2e57.firebaseapp.com",
        projectId: "linkup-d2e57",
        storageBucket: "linkup-d2e57.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "160583327704",
        appId: "1:160583327704:web:c5236e37b714c1665d9cad",
        measurementId: "G-VV6LV752WW"
    ),
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
   MyApp({super.key});
  final Future<FirebaseApp> _initialization = Firebase.initializeApp();

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LinkUp',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: FutureBuilder(
        future: _initialization,
        builder: (context, snapshot){
          if(snapshot.hasError){
            print('error');
          }
          if(snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done){
            return init();
          }
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        },
      ),
    );
